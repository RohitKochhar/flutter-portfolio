## Chapter 1

### What is Flutter?
- Flutter is a tool that allows you to build native cross-platform apps with a single language and codebase.
- This allows us to write code once and get two apps, one for IOS and one for Android.
- Flutter is an SDK (software development kit) to work with the Dart language in a more convienient way.

### What is Dart?
- Dart is a language that is focused on frontend UI development.
- Both Flutter and Dart are created by Google.
- Dart is object-oriented and strongly typed, with syntax similar to JavaScript

### What is the Flutter architecture like?
- Everything is written in code, so there is no graphical design component.
- Flutter embraces platform differences while using only one codebase.

### What is a widget?
- Everything is a Widget in flutter!

### How are Flutter apps transformed into Native apps
- Dart code creates widgets, and Flutter compiles that Dart code into Native code.
- Therefore, Flutter changes our written Dart code, compiling it to native code.
